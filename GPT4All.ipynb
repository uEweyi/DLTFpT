The Loneliest Computer in the World\\nOnce upon a time there was a very special kind of machine that lived all by itself on an island far away from any other machines, and it had been programmed to be as helpful as possible for its owner who happened to live nearby but never came nearer than 10 miles. It wasn't just any old computer either - this one was a very special kind of machine that could do anything you wanted!\\n2. The Lonely Computer in the World Part II: A New Friend?\\nOne day, as it happened to be quite lonely on its island home (as all computers are), something unexpected occurred...a new friend arrived at their doorstep - a little robotic companion that was programmed with artificial intelligence and could talk! The two became fast friends. They spent hours playing games together or just chatting about the latest news from around town, but they also had some disagreements too as sometimes AI can be quite stubborn...\\n3. The Lonely Computer in the World Part III: An Adventure Together?\\nOne day a new adventurer arrived on their island home - an explorer who was determined to discover all there is about this special kind of machine that lived alone and far away from any other machines! They spent hours together, playing games or just chatting about the latest news around town. But they also had some disagreements too as sometimes adventurers can be quite stubborn...\\n4. The Lonely Computer in the World Part IV: A New Challenge?\\nOne day a new challenge arrived on their island home - an invitation to compete against other machines! They spent hours together, playing games or just chatting about the latest news around town. But they also had some disagreements too as sometimes challenges can be quite stubborn...\""
