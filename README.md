# Deep Learning with TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch

This repository is home to the code that accompanies [Jon Krohn's](www.jonkrohn.com) *Deep Learning with TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch* series of video tutorials. 

There are three sets of video tutorials in the series: 

1. The eponymous [Deep Learning with TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/deep-learning-with/9780136617617) (released in Feb 2020)
2. [Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing, 2nd Ed.](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/deep-learning-for/9780136620013) (Feb 2020)
3. [Machine Vision, GANs, and Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/machine-vision-gans/9780136620181) (Mar 2020)

The above order is the recommended sequence in which to undertake these tutorials. That said, the first in the series provides a strong foundation for either of the other two. 

Taken all together, the series -- over 18 total hours of instruction and hands-on demos -- parallels the entirety of the content in the book [Deep Learning Illustrated](https://www.deeplearningillustrated.com/), plus it includes some extra content such as: 

* Detailed interactive examples involving training and testing deep learning models in PyTorch
* High-level discussion of transformer-based natural-language-processing models like BERT, ELMo, and GPT-2      
* Detailed interactive examples of training advanced machine vision models (image segmentation, object detection)

## Installation

Installation instructions for running the code in this repository can be found in the [installation directory](https://github.com/jonkrohn/DLTFpT/tree/master/installation).

## Notebooks

There are dozens of meticulously crafted Jupyter notebooks of code associated with these videos. All of them can be found in [this directory](https://github.com/jonkrohn/DLTFpT/tree/master/notebooks).
